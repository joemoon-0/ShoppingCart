1. Create the front-end functionality of shopping cart on a web page.
   Write all code from scratch.

2. Note that you are only creating the front-end of the shopping cart.
   A real, functioning shopping cart would allow the user to search for and select products to view and purchase from a server-side database. A real shopping cart would also also ask for payment information and submit the order data back to the server to complete the purchase. Your shopping cart will not be receiving nor sending data to the server. It will also not be asking for payment information. Include the following functionality in your shopping cart:

   - Add all shopping cart content to your web page using JavaScript.
   - Array of Objects: To simulate querying a server for data that is returned to the web page, store your product data in an array of custom JavaScript objects. Include at least five items for purchase. Include a product id, picture, a short name, a description, and a price for each item.
   - Create and append HTML elements: Use a JavaScript loop to read the data and information from the custom JavaScript objects to list the information on the web page.
   - Add: When the user selects an item, the shopping cart should add the item.
   - Remove: Add functionality so that a user may also remove an item from the shopping cart.
   - Drop-down List: Add some functionality with HTML <select> and <option> elements.
   - Total Calculation: The grand total should change based on adding or removing an item from the list or using the drop-down list.
